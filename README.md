## Python Challenge

The purpose of this exercise is to practice the newfound skills learned from Python.

In this activity, I am tasked with creating a Python script for analyzing the financial records of a company. I was provided with a financial dataset in this file: budget_data.csv. This dataset is composed of two columns, Date and Profit/Losses. 

My task was to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

The total number of months included in the dataset.

The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.

The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.

The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

When running the Python script, my resulting analysis looked similar to the following:

Financial Analysis
----------------------------
Total Months: 86

Total: $38382578

Average  Change: $-2315.12

Greatest Increase in Profits: Feb-2012 ($1926159)

Greatest Decrease in Profits: Sep-2013 ($-2196167)

Your final script should print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
